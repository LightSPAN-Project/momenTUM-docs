# Getting started

## Expected behaviour when the participant enrolls in study

Participants should receive notifications from the moment they enrol in the study. This means that when newly enrolled, no pending notifications should appear. 


## Specification of random interval notifications

Random notifications can be specified in each module for a given study under "Scheduled times" > "Random interval". The random interval describes the time window (in minutes) from the specified alert time, in which a notification can be randomised. Example: if "Alert time" of the module = 15h 30min and "Random interval" = 360 (corresponding to 6h), the notification will be randomised between 09h 30min (15h 30min - 6h) and 21h 30min (15h 30min + 6h).
