# Introduction

## Background

Clinical, biomedical, psychological and other studies with human participants often require the ability to collect data from the participants in an ambulatory fashion using mobile devices. Here, we present the momenTUM Research Platform, which facilitates the task of data collection. This page documents the momenTUM Research Platform for both Developers and Researchers.

**NOTE**: If you have been invited to participate in a study using the momenTUM Research Platform, please contact the researcher who invited you for support.
