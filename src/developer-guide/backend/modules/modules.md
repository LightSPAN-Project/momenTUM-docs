# Modules

The Backend project is structured into modules.
Modules are the single Rust files (.rs) inside of the project.
Each module groups related codeblocks together.

- [main.rs](#mainrs) - Entry point for the application
- [error.rs](#errorrs) - _todo: short description_
- [redcap.rs](#redcaprs) - Functions for interacting with the REDCap instance
- [study.rs](#studyrs) - _todo: short description_
- [users.rs](#usersrs) - _todo: short description_

Each module has its own chapter.
